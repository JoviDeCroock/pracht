## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#211](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/211) [`82286b3`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/82286b3a86e708c11e7287b9251ee62bf9cc0ae3) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - The capability graph: define a typed application operation once and project it to every surface — server code, a generated HTTP endpoint, WebMCP page tools for in-browser agents, the human UI, and llms.txt discovery — with a built-in agent trust layer. See docs/CAPABILITIES.md, docs/AGENT_TRUST.md, docs/LLMS_TXT.md, and the decision log in docs/CAPABILITY_GRAPH.md.

  **Capability core.** The new `@pracht/capabilities` package provides `defineCapability()`: a protocol-neutral operation with a dependency-free JSON Schema subset validator (unsupported keywords are rejected at definition time so they can never silently widen an exposed contract), effect classes (`read`/`write`/`destructive`), named middleware, and explicit exposure. Capabilities register in the app manifest via `defineApp({ capabilities: { ... } })` and are private by default. The package is also the single home of the wire protocol — `capabilityHttpPath()`, the confirmation and transport header names, the `CapabilityErrorCode` union, the envelope types, the schema→TypeScript printer, and the shared static extractor (`@pracht/capabilities/static`) — consumed by the framework, the Vite plugin, and the CLI so the contract cannot drift between packages. Static extraction masks regex literals during entry-point discovery, including regex expression statements after control-flow conditions, and accepts ECMAScript code-point escapes based on their numeric range rather than a fixed digit count.

  Capability validation also enforces the JSON data model at every boundary, including unconstrained/additional properties and schema `const`, `default`, and `enum` values, and applies JSON Schema string lengths by Unicode code point, so multipart files, prototype-named fields, astral Unicode characters, and other JavaScript-only values cannot bypass or distort validation and destructive-call confirmation bindings.

  The shared static extractor used by browser codegen and `pracht verify` ignores comments, string contents, and regex literals when locating capability definitions and registrations, parses both fixed-width and code-point Unicode escapes in inline literals, analyzes the module's default-exported capability, and scopes manifest extraction to the exported `defineApp()` configuration — so examples, commented-out code, or a helper capability defined earlier in the file cannot change the generated capability surface.

  **Projections.** `@pracht/core` resolves the registry and runs one dispatch pipeline (input validation → named middleware → `run()` → output validation) behind every surface: request-scoped `invokeCapability()` for direct server use (loaders, API routes, middleware), `POST /api/capabilities/<name>` with a typed `{ ok, data | error }` envelope, CSRF protection, and production redaction (custom HTTP paths that URL parsing could reinterpret as cross-origin or as a different pathname are rejected), and — via `@pracht/vite-plugin` — the generated `virtual:pracht/capabilities` browser client (`callCapability()`, with `confirm` sugar for confirmation tokens) and `virtual:pracht/webmcp`, a feature-detected WebMCP page-tool shim (`document.modelContext.registerTool`, Chrome origin trial). Direct invocation hosts are bound to their incoming `Request`, so overlapping apps or dev-server generations cannot route a call through another registry. Both virtual modules cost zero bytes when unused.

  **One contract for humans and agents.** `<Form capability="notes.create">` posts the framework's form component straight to the capability endpoint agents call: fields are coerced onto the input schema server-side, `onCapabilityResult` receives the typed envelope, and without JavaScript the endpoint accepts the form-encoded post and answers a successful document submission with a 303 back to the same-origin referring page. Enhanced submissions honor a clicked submitter's `formaction` and follow middleware redirects to their final browser URL, matching that no-JavaScript behavior: a redirect is handed back to the same-origin fetch as a readable target (with relative `Location` values resolved against the endpoint) and the browser navigates itself, so an external OAuth/SSO destination is never fetched through CORS and never submitted twice, and a cross-origin form target falls back to a native document submission (after client-side schema validation, if any). Effect classes drive the client cache: after any successful non-`read` browser call (`callCapability()` or `<Form capability>`) the active route's loader data revalidates automatically — a full reload under islands hydration — and `revalidate: false` opts out per call.

  **Agent trust layer.** Web Bot Auth verification (RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures, Ed25519 via WebCrypto, static keys or allowlisted `/.well-known/http-message-signatures-directory` JWKS lookups — fail closed everywhere) opts in via `defineApp({ agents: { webBotAuth } })` and surfaces the verified identity as `context.agent` — now typed end to end (`CapabilityContext`, `PrachtRequestContext`) with `"observe"`/`"require"` policies and per-capability `agentPolicy` overrides. Destructive capabilities may expose over HTTP only, gated by a server-verified prepare/commit confirmation flow (`409 confirmation_required` + short-lived HMAC token bound to principal, capability, and canonical input; requires `PRACHT_CONFIRMATION_SECRET`). The gate runs inside the named middleware chain, so rate limiting sees prepare and invalid-token attempts too. Every dispatch emits a structured audit event (`setCapabilityAuditHook()` / `onCapabilityAudit`) whose transport distinguishes `http`, `server`, and `webmcp`.

  **Discovery & DX.** The opt-in `pracht({ llmsTxt })` option emits llms.txt (https://llmstxt.org) from the resolved app graph — pages, API endpoints, and HTTP-exposed capabilities with effect classes — written at build time and served live in dev; `create-pracht` templates enable it by default. `pracht typegen` emits `src/pracht-capabilities.d.ts` so `invokeCapability()`, `callCapability()`, `<Form capability>`, and the test host infer input/output types from the capability name. `pracht eval` runs scripted agent-task scenarios (with `$steps[n]` references and a `confirm` field for the confirmation flow) against a live app, `--start` managing the server lifecycle. `createCapabilityTestHost()` unit-tests the full pipeline including simulated agent identities. `pracht inspect capabilities`, the MCP `inspect_capabilities` tool, `/_pracht` devtools, and the dev banner all render the same graph — with declared-but-unserved `expose.mcp` labeled `mcp(unserved)` and warned about by `pracht verify` until the remote MCP projection ships.

### Minor Changes

- [#226](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/226) [`53e6a7b`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/53e6a7bbb6caca65a5464edab92d17659ef65166) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Seed Claude Code agent tooling into scaffolded apps. New projects now get the full pracht skill catalog copied into `.claude/skills/` and a `.mcp.json` registering the `pracht mcp` server, behind a yes-default "Set up Claude Code skills + MCP?" prompt (`--agent-tools` / `--no-agent-tools` for non-interactive runs; `--yes` includes the tooling). The skills ship inside the published package via a build-time sync from the repo's `skills/` directory.

### Patch Changes

- [#229](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/229) [`7342039`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/7342039ed530f4a1c2321ae6c3924dfa9fd491b9) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - First-class not-found page: `defineApp({ notFound })` and `notFound()`.

  Until now the only way to ship a custom 404 was a trailing catch-all route
  (`route("/*", ...)`), which matches _every_ URL — so it shadows requests for
  static assets and paths the app might serve later, shows up in typed routes,
  prefetching, speculation rules, and SSG path enumeration, and stops the client
  router from ever falling back to a document navigation for an unknown URL.

  - `defineApp({ notFound })` accepts a module ref or
    `{ component, loader?, shell?, middleware?, hydration? }`. It is **not** a
    route: it never participates in matching, so it runs only after matching (and,
    on every first-party adapter, static-asset serving) has failed. It renders
    through the normal pipeline — loader, shell, `head`, hydration — with a 404
    status, and hydrates under a reserved route id.
  - `notFound(message?)` returns a `PrachtHttpError(404)` to throw from a loader
    or middleware: `if (!post) throw notFound()`. The response is the app's
    not-found page unless the route module exports its own `ErrorBoundary`, which
    still wins. Shell-level error boundaries no longer intercept 404s once
    `notFound` is configured.
  - Route-state (JSON) requests, non-GET/HEAD requests, and apps without a
    `notFound` page keep their existing 404 behavior.
  - Pages router: `pages/404.tsx` is wired as the not-found page automatically and
    removed from the route table, so `/404` is not a URL of its own.
  - `pracht dev` renders the app's own 404 page (instead of the dev-only route
    table) when one is declared, matching production. `pracht inspect routes`,
    the dev banner, and the `/_pracht` devtools page now report it.

- [#227](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/227) [`488aeed`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/488aeedd54c9beb97b6334c72580c579d24be2d3) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Teach the starter about the verify / plan / report loop. Manifest scaffolds now include a commented-out `constraints` example in `src/routes.ts` (enforced by `pracht verify` once uncommented), the generated `.gitignore` notes that `.pracht/app-graph.json` — the `pracht plan` snapshot — should stay committed, the generated README gains a short Checks section, and the agent instructions list `pracht verify`, `pracht plan --write`, `pracht report`, and `pracht llms --write`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#174](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/174) [`4d494c7`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/4d494c791ca079dcb5cfebc059cbf53c46e9de90) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Polish the starter CLI:

  - Add a Tailwind CSS option — a yes/no prompt plus `--tailwind` / `--no-tailwind` flags — that wires `tailwindcss` and `@tailwindcss/vite` into `vite.config.ts`, generates `src/styles/global.css`, and imports it from the shell.
  - Add a `--template=minimal|tailwind` flag as the non-interactive umbrella (minimal is the current output, tailwind adds the Tailwind wiring).
  - Initialize a git repository with an "Initial commit from create-pracht" commit after scaffolding, skipped with `--no-git`, when git is unavailable, or when the target directory is already inside a repository.
  - Generate a multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` for Node adapter scaffolds, and document `docker build` in the generated README.

- [#175](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/175) [`439bc22`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/439bc22a7a92baf2e450ecf6c9fa9b6e0d43b22d) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Add `pracht preview` to serve the production build locally with one command. It runs `pracht build` first (skippable with `--skip-build`) and then serves the output for the configured adapter: Node targets run `dist/server/server.js` as a child process (`--port <n>`, `$PORT`, default 3000), Cloudflare targets delegate to `wrangler dev` against the built worker (with an actionable error when wrangler or its config is missing), and Vercel targets print guidance towards `vercel build`/`vercel dev` since there is no faithful local production runtime. Scaffolded Node and Cloudflare starters now include a `preview` script.

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- [#131](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/131) [`015e987`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/015e987a2de471980fab557e3dbf3d52937ad0ac) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Security hardening across request handling, redirects, and build output.

  **Framework (`@pracht/core`)**

  - **Middleware/loader redirects are now validated.** `javascript:`, `data:`,
    `vbscript:`, `blob:`, and `file:` targets are refused server-side (they
    were already refused on the client) and CR/LF in the `Location` value
    throws instead of producing a split response. Non-safe-method redirects
    now default to **303 See Other** rather than 302 so browsers don't
    resend the POST body to the redirect target. `MiddlewareResult`'s
    `redirect` form now accepts an optional `status` override.
  - **CSRF protection for mutating API routes.** Non-GET API requests are
    rejected with 403 unless the browser signals a same-origin/same-site
    fetch (`Sec-Fetch-Site`) or the `Origin` header matches the request
    URL's origin. Opt out per-app via `defineApp({ api: { requireSameOrigin: false } })`.
  - **`_data=1` route-state bypass is now gated.** The query-param form of
    the route-state endpoint now requires `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`/
    `same-site` (or a matching `Origin`). The explicit
    `x-pracht-route-state-request` header is still accepted unconditionally
    (CORS-protected).
  - **Catch-all path traversal at build time is closed.**
    `buildPathFromSegments` now percent-encodes catch-all components
    individually and explicitly neutralises `.` / `..` segments, so a
    `getStaticPaths` returning `{ "*": "../../etc/passwd" }` can no longer
    escape `dist/client/` at SSG/ISG write time.
  - **`headers()` values are validated for CR/LF.** `applyHeaders` now
    throws a consistent framework error on response-splitting attempts,
    regardless of adapter-specific Headers implementation behaviour.
  - **`debugErrors` is ignored in production.** When `NODE_ENV=production`,
    `debugErrors: true` is refused (with a one-shot console warning) so a
    misconfigured deploy cannot leak stack traces and module paths.

  **Adapter (`@pracht/adapter-node`)**

  - **Symlinks are no longer followed by the static server.** `resolveStaticFile`
    now uses `lstat` and rejects files whose inode is a symlink, preventing
    a malicious build artifact from exposing files outside `dist/client/`.
  - **ISG cache is path-contained.** The on-disk write path is now
    `resolve()`-checked against the static root, rejecting any URL path
    that would escape via `..`, encoded separators, or NUL bytes.
  - **ISG skips the on-disk cache when the response is user-specific.**
    Responses that set `Cache-Control: no-store`/`private`, `Set-Cookie`,
    or a `Vary` covering `cookie`/`authorization`/`*` are served through
    but not written to disk, closing a per-user cache-poisoning window.

  **Packaging**

  - `@pracht/cli` now has an explicit `files` allowlist so future
    workdir additions can't accidentally ship in the npm tarball.
  - `create-pracht`'s bin entry is now executable in the repository.
