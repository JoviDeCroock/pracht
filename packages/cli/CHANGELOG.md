# @pracht/cli

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#179](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/179) [`67bc60b`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/67bc60b5a0439beb91fc7332ea6bac9520108d70) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Add `pracht build --analyze` and per-route client JS budgets.

  `pracht build --analyze` prints a per-route report of the client JavaScript each route loads: the transitive chunks (route module + shell) with raw and gzip sizes, a total row per route, and the shared entry chunks broken out. `--json` emits the same data as machine-readable JSON. Output respects `NO_COLOR` and routes are sorted by total gzip size, descending.

  The pracht plugin accepts a new `budgets` option (e.g. `budgets: { "*": "120kb", "/dashboard": "200kb" }`) declaring per-route gzip client-JS ceilings; `"*"` applies to every route and explicit route paths override it. `pracht build` evaluates budgets after every build, prints pass/fail per route, writes `dist/server/budget-report.json`, and exits non-zero on exceeded budgets unless `--no-budget-fail` is passed. `pracht verify` and `pracht doctor` surface the last build's budget results when the report file is present.

- [#183](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/183) [`9db0a58`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/9db0a5897216eb049cc99f0d53adb5dad34314b9) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - `pracht build` for the Cloudflare target now writes a thin deploy entry at
  `dist/server/worker.js` that re-exports only the default handler and the
  `workerExportsFrom` entrypoint classes. workerd validates every named export
  of the deployed entry module and rejects the build metadata (`buildTarget`,
  asset manifests, `resolvedApp`, ...) that `dist/server/server.js` exports for
  the SSG prerender pass, so pointing `wrangler.jsonc`'s `main` at `server.js`
  failed to boot with `Incorrect type for map entry 'buildTarget'`. Point `main`
  at `dist/server/worker.js` instead. The generated server entry now also
  exports `cloudflareWorkerEntrypointNames` so the CLI knows which classes to
  re-export.

- [#178](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/178) [`d27b96a`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/d27b96a68354b69d06cdfdd9667956631283ce1a) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Add a dev-server startup banner and a rich dev-only 404 page.

  `pracht dev` now prints a route table on startup — every page route with its
  render mode, shell, and middleware, plus API routes with their HTTP methods —
  alongside the local URL. The banner reuses the resolved-app-graph logic shared
  with `pracht inspect` and respects `NO_COLOR`.

  In dev mode, document navigations that match no page route and no API route now
  render a styled standalone 404 page (new `@pracht/core/dev-404` entry, same
  self-contained approach as the error overlay) listing all registered routes
  with render modes and links plus the requested path. The module is only loaded
  by the dev middleware; production 404 behavior is unchanged.

- [#173](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/173) [`004e429`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/004e4295db64bea56a283848db352b3c29909a45) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Add `pracht mcp`, a stdio Model Context Protocol server built into the CLI. It exposes the existing command internals as native MCP tools for coding agents: `inspect_routes`, `inspect_api`, `inspect_build`, `doctor`, `verify` (with optional `changed` scope), and `generate_route` / `generate_shell` / `generate_middleware` / `generate_api`. Every tool accepts an optional `cwd`, returns the same JSON payloads as the corresponding `--json` CLI flags, and surfaces failures as `isError` results instead of crashing the server. See docs/MCP.md for registration instructions and the tool reference.

- [#175](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/175) [`439bc22`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/439bc22a7a92baf2e450ecf6c9fa9b6e0d43b22d) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Add `pracht preview` to serve the production build locally with one command. It runs `pracht build` first (skippable with `--skip-build`) and then serves the output for the configured adapter: Node targets run `dist/server/server.js` as a child process (`--port <n>`, `$PORT`, default 3000), Cloudflare targets delegate to `wrangler dev` against the built worker (with an actionable error when wrangler or its config is missing), and Vercel targets print guidance towards `vercel build`/`vercel dev` since there is no faithful local production runtime. Scaffolded Node and Cloudflare starters now include a `preview` script.

- [#177](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/177) [`c1b22c4`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/c1b22c4e786a485c969143de48cd2be7f5f03fe8) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Add zero-generic typed loader data keyed by route id.

  `pracht typegen` now registers each route's loader data type on
  `Register["routes"]` in the generated `src/pracht-routes.d.ts`, pointing at the
  route module (or the separate loader module wired via the manifest, which wins
  over an inline loader like at runtime). `@pracht/core` gains a
  `RouteLoaderData<TModule, TFallbackModule?>` utility type, a
  `RouteDataFor<TRouteId>` helper, and a new `useRouteData(routeId)` overload
  that returns the mapped loader data with route-id autocomplete — no generic
  needed. The existing `useRouteData<typeof loader>()` form keeps working as the
  fallback for projects that do not run typegen. In development, passing a route
  id that is not the active route logs a warning.

### Patch Changes

- [#185](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/185) [`b83f5b7`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/b83f5b7d6d92f22c982bad4fb62a9be00dd56a97) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - `pracht build` now stubs `cloudflare:*` platform modules (via Node module
  hooks) while importing the built server bundle for SSG prerendering. Edge
  server bundles keep these imports external because they only exist inside
  workerd, so any app whose worker graph imports `cloudflare:workers` or
  `cloudflare:email` previously failed the prerender pass with
  `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME`.

- [#180](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/180) [`ab693d5`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/ab693d5ac04a1c7b3815c70396ab2e9a3a258072) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Add a dev-only `/_pracht` devtools page and `Server-Timing` phase headers.

  - The dev server now serves a self-contained devtools page at `/_pracht` listing every page route (pattern, render mode, shell, middleware chain, source file) and API route (path, methods, source file), with the same data available as JSON at `/_pracht.json`. The path is reserved in dev only — a colliding user route logs a warning in dev and still wins in production.
  - Dev SSR responses now carry a standards-compliant `Server-Timing` header (e.g. `mw;dur=1.2, loader;dur=14.8, render;dur=3.1`) so middleware/loader/render phase durations show up in the browser Network panel. The runtime only records timings when the new `HandlePrachtRequestOptions.timings` collector is passed; production requests skip all timing work.
  - `@pracht/core` gains a shared app-graph module (`buildAppGraph`, `serializeAppRoutes`, `serializeApiRoutes`, `detectApiMethods`, and a new `@pracht/core/devtools` entry) that both `pracht inspect` and the devtools page use, so the CLI and the page report the same graph.

### Minor Changes

- [#153](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/153) [`39860bd`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/39860bd31e8559916d8f81ffa6122ac4cf1cffd1) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - **Breaking:** Middleware is now wrap-around (Hono/Koa/Astro shape). The
  `MiddlewareFn` signature changes from `(args) => MiddlewareResult` to
  `(args, next) => Promise<Response>`.

  ```ts
  // Before
  export const middleware: MiddlewareFn = async ({ request }) => {
    if (!hasSession(request)) return { redirect: "/login" };
    return { context: { user: "jovi" } };
  };

  // After
  import { redirect, type MiddlewareFn } from "@pracht/core";

  export const middleware: MiddlewareFn = async (
    { context, request },
    next
  ) => {
    if (!hasSession(request)) return redirect("/login");
    (context as { user?: string }).user = "jovi";
    return next();
  };
  ```

  Why: middleware can now wrap `try / catch / finally` around the rest of the
  request, which is the standard shape for tracing, logging, and observability
  libraries (Honeycomb, OpenTelemetry, Sentry). It also matches what users
  arriving from honox / Hono / Astro / SvelteKit / Koa expect.

  Migration notes:

  - Replace `return { redirect: "/path" }` with `return redirect("/path")`
    using the new `redirect` helper exported from `@pracht/core`.
  - Replace `return { context: { ... } }` with direct mutation of
    `args.context`. Context is shared by reference between middleware and
    the loader/handler.
  - Replace bare `return` (continue) with `return next()`.
  - Middleware that returns a `Response` directly still works as a
    short-circuit.
  - The `MiddlewareResult` type is removed; `MiddlewareNext` is exported.
  - One `AbortSignal` is now shared per request across all middleware and
    the loader/handler instead of a fresh 30s timer per phase. This makes
    long-running middleware count toward the same overall budget as the
    loader/handler, which matches how most users reason about per-request
    timeouts.

  The CLI's `pracht generate middleware` scaffold emits the new signature.

  - `@pracht/adapter-node` now supports `canonicalOrigin` so apps can pin
    `request.url` to a known public origin instead of depending on untrusted
    `Host` values. The adapter also treats both `x-pracht-route-state-request`
    and `?_data=1` as route-state transports before any static/ISG HTML serving,
    and ISG regeneration now uses a clean HTML request instead of replaying the
    triggering user's cookies or authorization headers.
  - `@pracht/adapter-cloudflare` now bypasses static asset serving for both
    route-state transports (`x-pracht-route-state-request` and `?_data=1`).
  - `@pracht/cli` now emits a Vercel Build Output rule that sends `?_data=1`
    requests to the render function before static rewrites can serve prerendered
    HTML.

- [#131](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/pull/131) [`015e987`](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock/pracht/commit/015e987a2de471980fab557e3dbf3d52937ad0ac) Thanks [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock)! - Security hardening across request handling, redirects, and build output.

  **Framework (`@pracht/core`)**

  - **Middleware/loader redirects are now validated.** `javascript:`, `data:`,
    `vbscript:`, `blob:`, and `file:` targets are refused server-side (they
    were already refused on the client) and CR/LF in the `Location` value
    throws instead of producing a split response. Non-safe-method redirects
    now default to **303 See Other** rather than 302 so browsers don't
    resend the POST body to the redirect target. `MiddlewareResult`'s
    `redirect` form now accepts an optional `status` override.
  - **CSRF protection for mutating API routes.** Non-GET API requests are
    rejected with 403 unless the browser signals a same-origin/same-site
    fetch (`Sec-Fetch-Site`) or the `Origin` header matches the request
    URL's origin. Opt out per-app via `defineApp({ api: { requireSameOrigin: false } })`.
  - **`_data=1` route-state bypass is now gated.** The query-param form of
    the route-state endpoint now requires `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`/
    `same-site` (or a matching `Origin`). The explicit
    `x-pracht-route-state-request` header is still accepted unconditionally
    (CORS-protected).
  - **Catch-all path traversal at build time is closed.**
    `buildPathFromSegments` now percent-encodes catch-all components
    individually and explicitly neutralises `.` / `..` segments, so a
    `getStaticPaths` returning `{ "*": "../../etc/passwd" }` can no longer
    escape `dist/client/` at SSG/ISG write time.
  - **`headers()` values are validated for CR/LF.** `applyHeaders` now
    throws a consistent framework error on response-splitting attempts,
    regardless of adapter-specific Headers implementation behaviour.
  - **`debugErrors` is ignored in production.** When `NODE_ENV=production`,
    `debugErrors: true` is refused (with a one-shot console warning) so a
    misconfigured deploy cannot leak stack traces and module paths.

  **Adapter (`@pracht/adapter-node`)**

  - **Symlinks are no longer followed by the static server.** `resolveStaticFile`
    now uses `lstat` and rejects files whose inode is a symlink, preventing
    a malicious build artifact from exposing files outside `dist/client/`.
  - **ISG cache is path-contained.** The on-disk write path is now
    `resolve()`-checked against the static root, rejecting any URL path
    that would escape via `..`, encoded separators, or NUL bytes.
  - **ISG skips the on-disk cache when the response is user-specific.**
    Responses that set `Cache-Control: no-store`/`private`, `Set-Cookie`,
    or a `Vary` covering `cookie`/`authorization`/`*` are served through
    but not written to disk, closing a per-user cache-poisoning window.

  **Packaging**

  - `@pracht/cli` now has an explicit `files` allowlist so future
    workdir additions can't accidentally ship in the npm tarball.
  - `create-pracht`'s bin entry is now executable in the repository.

  Page responses now vary on `x-pracht-route-state-request`, framework-generated
  route-state responses default to `Cache-Control: no-store`, and Node/preview
  cached HTML paths no longer intercept route-state fetches. Vercel build output
  now routes route-state requests to the edge function before static rewrites.

Hashed assets under /assets/ get immutable caching; HTML gets must-revalidate. Preview server now mirrors production caching behavior.

  Cloudflare static assets now inherit the same permissions-policy, referrer-policy, x-content-type-options, and x-frame-options headers that dynamic responses already receive. Vercel build output config now emits a headers section so static files served by Vercel's CDN also get the baseline security headers.

  Two issues caused prerendered (SSG) pages to ship without working hydration:

  1. **Vite 8 environment nesting**: The `@cloudflare/vite-plugin` outputs client assets
     to `<outDir>/client/`, so `outDir: "dist/client"` produced `dist/client/client/`.
     The CLI then couldn't find the Vite manifest, resulting in no `<script>` tag in
     prerendered HTML. Fixed by setting `outDir: "dist"`.

  2. **Dual Preact context copies**: The CLI imported `prerenderApp` from its own
     `@pracht/core`, while the server bundle had its own bundled copy. Different
     `createContext` instances meant `useLocation()` returned `/` during prerendering,
     breaking shell features like active link highlighting. Fixed by re-exporting
     `prerenderApp` from the server module so the CLI uses the same bundled copy.
