# Pracht Audit Secrets

Pracht serializes loader return values into the `pracht-state` JSON script and
hydrates the client from them. Anything a loader returns ends up readable in the
browser. The Vite plugin also strips server-only exports from route files, but
it cannot save you from a value that flows into the return.

## Step 0: Run the native env safety check

Pracht has built-in env leak detection (see `docs/ENV.md`):

- `pracht build` fails when a client chunk references a non-public env var
  (anything not `PRACHT_PUBLIC_`-prefixed and not a Vite built-in), naming the
  variable, chunk, and likely source module.
- `pracht verify` re-runs that scan against an existing `dist/client` output.
- Client-side imports of `@pracht/core/env/server` (`serverEnv`) fail the build.

Run `pracht verify` (or a build) first and fold its findings into the report.
Check `vite.config.*` for `envSafety: { allow: [...] }` / `envSafety: false` —
every allowlisted name and a disabled check are findings to review, since they
bypass the native gate. The native check detects *references*, not values, so
the dataflow steps below are still required.

## Step 1: Identify "secret-shaped" identifiers

Build a regex of variable names treated as sensitive:

```
SECRET|TOKEN|API[_-]?KEY|PRIVATE[_-]?KEY|PASSWORD|PASSPHRASE|SESSION[_-]?SECRET|JWT[_-]?SECRET|WEBHOOK[_-]?SECRET|DATABASE[_-]?URL|DB[_-]?URL|CONNECTION[_-]?STRING|CLIENT[_-]?SECRET|REFRESH[_-]?TOKEN
```

Also flag any direct `process.env.X` or `context.env.X` reference where `X`
matches the above.

## Step 2: Server → client flow analysis

For every route file, trace whether a sensitive value reaches the loader's
return value. Steps:

1. Run `pracht inspect routes --json` to enumerate routes.
2. For each route, read the loader.
3. Build a small dataflow trace from sensitive identifiers (and `process.env.*`
   / `context.env.*` reads) to the `return` statement(s).
4. Flag any spread (`...row`, `...user`, `...env`) that originates from a
   source containing secrets.
5. Flag direct returns of objects that name sensitive keys.

This is heuristic — favor over-flagging over silent leaks. Note false-positive
risk in the report.

## Step 3: Module import boundaries

Grep client-rendered files (route components, shells, anything imported from
them) for imports of:
- `node:*` builtins
- `@pracht/adapter-*`
- Local `src/server/**` modules
- Modules whose top level reads `process.env.*`

The Vite plugin strips `loader`, `getStaticPaths`, `headers`, `middleware`
exports from route files when serving the client query — see commit 594407d.
But a component that imports `../server/db` will still pull `db` into the
client bundle. Flag those imports.

## Step 4: Hidden surfaces

Check for accidental exposure outside loaders:

- `head()` returns: rare, but a `meta` value containing a token leaks into HTML.
- `headers()` returns: flag values that look like secrets. For SSG/ISG pages,
  document headers can be copied into `dist/client/_pracht/headers.json`, which
  is public client output and may be replayed on static responses.
- `<Form>` `action` URLs containing tokens in the query string.
- `prefetchRouteState(url)` calls with sensitive query params.
- Inline `<script>` content emitted from custom shells.

## Step 5: `.env` discipline

- Confirm `.env*` is in `.gitignore`.
- Confirm generated starters preserve `!.env.example` if they ignore `.env*`.
- Grep tracked files for likely committed secrets (long random strings near
  identifier names from step 1).
- Confirm client-side env access goes through `publicEnv` (from
  `@pracht/core`) or `import.meta.env.PRACHT_PUBLIC_*` / `import.meta.env.VITE_*`
  — both prefixes are intentionally public and inlined into the client bundle;
  warn loudly if a `PRACHT_PUBLIC_` or `VITE_` variable has a secret-shaped name.
- Confirm server-side env access uses `serverEnv` (from
  `@pracht/core/env/server`) or `context.env` rather than ad-hoc globals.

## Step 6: Report

| File:Line | Identifier / source | Sink (loader return / client import / etc.) | Severity |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------- |

Severities:
- `error` — direct flow from `process.env.SECRET_*` / `serverEnv.SECRET_*` to
  loader return.
- `error` — `PRACHT_PUBLIC_*_SECRET` / `VITE_*_SECRET` style client-public
  secret-shaped name.
- `error` — `envSafety: false` or an allowlisted name that looks secret-shaped.
- `warn` — spread of a row that may contain secret columns.
- `warn` — client component imports a module that reads `process.env`.
- `info` — header value that looks like a token.

## Rules

1. Heuristic-first; document false-positive risk per finding.
2. Recommend an explicit allowlist projection (`{ id, name, email }`) over
   blocklist filtering.
3. For Cloudflare apps, secrets live in `context.env` — same risk profile as
   `process.env`. Treat them identically.
4. Never print suspected secret values into the report — refer by name only.
5. If you find a likely committed secret, recommend immediate rotation in
   addition to removal from history.
