# Pracht Audit Auth

What the framework guarantees: middleware runs wrap-around style — every
middleware must return a `Response` (the runtime throws if it doesn't), either
`return next()` to continue the chain or a short-circuit `Response` to stop it.
The `redirect()` helper from `@pracht/core` returns a scheme/CRLF-validated
redirect `Response`. What the framework does NOT decide is *which* routes get
an auth gate — that is app wiring, and this skill audits it.

The pracht auth pattern (see `examples/docs/src/routes/docs/recipes-auth.md`):
middleware checks the session, short-circuits with a redirect on absence, and
forwards user info via request headers; loaders downstream read the headers.

Prerequisites: `pracht inspect` requires a vite config that registers the
pracht plugin.

## Step 1: Identify the auth middleware(s)

```bash
pracht inspect routes --json
```

If the pracht MCP server is registered (see `docs/MCP.md`), prefer its tools
(`inspect_routes`, `inspect_api`, `inspect_build`, `doctor`, `verify`) over
shelling out.

Middleware is registered by name in the app manifest —
`defineApp({ middleware: { auth: () => import("./middleware/auth.ts") } })` —
and `inspect` reports those names, not files. Read the name→file map from
`src/routes.ts` (or the configured manifest) to resolve each name, then read
each middleware file and classify it:

- **Gate** — on auth failure, returns a short-circuit `Response`
  (`redirect("/login", { request })`, or a 401/403 `Response`) WITHOUT calling
  `next()`; on success, `return next()`.
- **Augmenter** — mutates request headers/context with user info, then always
  returns `next()`. Never short-circuits.
- **Other** — non-auth middleware (rate limit, logging, CORS, etc.).

The "Augmenter" category is the silent killer: it makes loaders *think*
auth is enforced because `request.headers.get('x-user-id')` returns a value
when present, but unauthenticated requests just get `null` and the loader has
to handle it. Flag every loader downstream of an Augmenter that doesn't.

## Step 2: Identify protected routes

A route is "expected protected" if any of:

- It has `auth`/`session`/`requireUser`/similar middleware applied.
- Its loader reads `x-user-id`/`x-user-email`/`getSession`/equivalent.
- It lives under conventional protected paths: `/dashboard*`, `/admin*`,
  `/account*`, `/settings*`, `/app*` (ask the user to confirm the
  convention if unclear).
- The user has flagged it explicitly.

Build a list of expected-protected routes.

## Step 3: Check coverage per protected route

For each expected-protected route:

1. From `pracht inspect routes --json`, read the resolved `middleware` array.
2. Confirm at least one **Gate** middleware is present.
3. Confirm the gate runs **before** any other middleware that depends on
   identity (order matters).
4. If only an Augmenter is present, mark as `augmented-only`.

## Step 4: Check the API surface

Mutation endpoints (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`) are the highest-impact
target. From `pracht inspect api --json`:

- Each API route reports `path`, `file`, `methods`, and `hasDefaultHandler`
  (the last requires a current `@pracht/cli`). A `default`-export handler
  serves ALL methods but reports `methods: []` — treat
  `hasDefaultHandler: true` as "every method exposed". On older CLIs where
  the field is missing, grep the handler file for `export default` instead.
- For each mutation handler (named method export or default handler), check
  whether `defineApp({ api: { middleware } })` applies a Gate, OR the handler
  reads/validates a session itself.
- Common bug: dashboard route is protected by middleware, but
  `POST /api/items` is not — attacker bypasses the UI entirely.

## Step 5: Client/server enforcement parity

Grep client components for patterns like `if (!user) return <Login />`. For
each occurrence, confirm that **the data path is also gated server-side**.
Client-side gating without a server gate is purely cosmetic and a common
source of "I see the data flash before redirect" or worse, leaked data via
SPA route loaders.

## Step 6: Session cookie sanity

Cross-reference with `audit-csrf`: the same cookies that authorize the user
are the CSRF target. Recommend running `audit-csrf` after this skill.

## Step 7: Report

| Route/API | Expected | Resolved middleware | Gate present? | Severity | Verdict |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------- |

Severity is the primary scale; the verdict is a secondary domain label:

- `error` / `unprotected` — no auth middleware on a route the user expects
  protected.
- `error` / `inconsistent` — UI route is gated; sibling API is not.
- `warn` / `augmented-only` — middleware reads session but never blocks;
  loader must handle null user.
- `warn` / `client-only` — server allows; client hides UI.
- `info` / `protected` — gate confirmed.
- `info` / `public-by-design` — deliberately exposed (login, signup,
  marketing).

## Rules

1. The framework's `pracht inspect routes --json` and `pracht inspect api
   --json` are the source of truth — group inheritance is already resolved.
2. Recognize Gates by behavior (short-circuits with a `Response` without
   calling `next()` on failure), not by filename — projects use `auth.ts`,
   `requireUser.ts`, `session.ts`, etc.
3. An Augmenter is a valid pattern when paired with a separate Gate or a
   loader that explicitly handles the unauthenticated case. Flag it; don't
   condemn it.
4. Public routes deliberately exposed (login, signup, marketing) should be
   listed but not flagged.
5. Do not auto-add middleware. Auth wiring is policy.
