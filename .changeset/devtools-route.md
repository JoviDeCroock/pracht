Add a dev-only `/_pracht` devtools page and `Server-Timing` phase headers.

- The dev server now serves a self-contained devtools page at `/_pracht` listing every page route (pattern, render mode, shell, middleware chain, source file) and API route (path, methods, source file), with the same data available as JSON at `/_pracht.json`. The path is reserved in dev only — a colliding user route logs a warning in dev and still wins in production.
- Dev SSR responses now carry a standards-compliant `Server-Timing` header (e.g. `mw;dur=1.2, loader;dur=14.8, render;dur=3.1`) so middleware/loader/render phase durations show up in the browser Network panel. The runtime only records timings when the new `HandlePrachtRequestOptions.timings` collector is passed; production requests skip all timing work.
- `@pracht/core` gains a shared app-graph module (`buildAppGraph`, `serializeAppRoutes`, `serializeApiRoutes`, `detectApiMethods`, and a new `@pracht/core/devtools` entry) that both `pracht inspect` and the devtools page use, so the CLI and the page report the same graph.
